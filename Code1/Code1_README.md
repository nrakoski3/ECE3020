Code1 takes in a number N and generates N random numbers between 0.0-1.0, then prints statistics of these random numbers using the standard I/O library "cout" from 3 different sudo random number generating functions for comparison.

The first function is the what comes built into the standard C++ library and will be refered to as "Built-In". The other 2 functions are LFSR and LGD which are both written by me. They both use different bit shifting methods to produce sudo random numbers.
